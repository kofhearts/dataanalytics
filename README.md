# Data Analytics Project

This project was all about descriptive and predictive analysis with Air Pollution in Seoul Between 2017 and 2019. 

# Abstract

The following research report is based on Seoul's air pollution from 2017 to 2019. The data analytics in this paper comprises mainly six levels namely: Background Information and Problem; Data Preparation; Data Mining; Evaluation and Result from analysis and Future work. The aim of data analytics is to investigate past data on air pollutants to gather insights on how the air pollutants have evolved and see if a predictive model can be created. Some of the factors investigated are the time of the day, the month
of the year, and year time between 2017 and 2019, etc. Machine learning techniques have also been used to forecast the types of pollutants that will be present in the future.
